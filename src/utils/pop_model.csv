1,"Died last night in my dreams. Walking the streets. Of some old ghost town. I tried to believe. In God and James Dean. But Hollywood sold out. Saw all of the saints. Lock up the gates. I could not enter. Walked into the flames. Called out your name. But there's no answer. And now I know my heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. Died last night in my dreams. All the machines. Had been disconnected. Time was thrown at the wind. And all of my friends. Had been disaffected. Now I'm searching for trust. In a city of rust. A city of vampires. Tonight Elvis is dead. And everyone's spread. And love is a satire. And now I know my heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. There's no one left in the world. I'm gunslingin'. Don't give a damn if I go. Down down down. I got a voice in my head that keeps singin'. Oh. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. Oh, my heart is a ghost town. (Said, my heart). My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town",224

I've taken my bows. And my curtain calls. You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it. I thank you all. But it's been no bed of roses. No pleasure cruise. I consider it a challenge before the whole human race. And I ain't gonna lose. We are the champions, my friends. And we'll keep on fighting till the end. We are the champions. We are the champions. No time for losers. 'Cause we are the champions of the world",153
3,"So I got my boots on,. Got the right amount of leather. And I'm doing me up with a black colored liner. And I'm working my strut but I know it don't matter. All we need in this world is some love.

In st petersburg the door slides open. IÂim a dead man till i see her walk through. Falling dove",150

When I'm pickin' up a fallen star. Downstairs the late show's blastin' 'Age of the rock'. Greedy monks playin' last Sunday at the Milky Way. Mom's writing checks to the minister in the corner. Singing, 'Dig Down Deep'. 'Cause if you wanna go to Heaven all you gotta do is pay to pray. Joining a fan club with my pen. Filling my bathtub with holy water and amens. He looks so dreamy, I'm in love from afar. When I'm pickin' up a fallen star. Shake that woody, shake it for me, St. Pinocchio. You've paid your money, now watch that money grow. Joining a fan club, best be warned. He turns me on when he wears that lampshade crown of thorns. We'd be so dreamy, sharing his black caviar. While I'm pickin' up a fallen star.

Your television takes a stand. And you find that what was over there. Is over here. So you scream from behind your door. Say ""what's mine is mine and not yours"". I may have too much but I'll take my chances. Because god's stopped keeping score. And you cling to the things they sold you. Did you cover your eyes when they told you. That he can't come back.

There it goes again, the slamming of the door. Sometimes the river calls me. And at night it calls my name. Says ""put your troubles down beside me"". Things have always been the same....
